# Raylee

This fork provide an interface for processing to the MSNoise-tomo 2D group velocity maps. The raylee code is used to complete the 1D shear wave velocity inversion from each pixel in the 2D tomography maps.

Note: you can copy the code _run\_raylee.m_ to any where you like (e.g. you tomography folder). You just need to point back to this _raylee\_codes_ directory in the .m file so that MATLAB can find the source code for the raylee inversion.
